## FAQ

### You have unsigned commits, why?

I am trying out [vigilant mode](https://docs.github.com/github/authenticating-to-github/displaying-verification-statuses-for-all-of-your-commits) on GitHub, starting from November 1st 2021. Any commits before this that is "unverified" is still me, but I will try and verify each commit going forward.

### What coding style do you use?

I try to have a consistent coding style when I code, so I made this linting config: https://github.com/promise/eslint-config - This is *my* style and everyone has their own style, but feel free to use this as a template to find your own style.

### What config do you use for Renovate?

I have my own mutual config repository I use everywhere here: https://github.com/promise/renovate-config - If you plan on using it yourself then I suggest you fork it as I might update stuff on-the-go as I please.

### Could you help me with my code?

**TL;DR: Maybe.** You can join my [Discord](https://promise.solutions/discord) and go to the #coding channel (below #general), there's plenty of developers in the server and they all having different experiences with different languages and packages. We can, of course, not guarantee you'll get your answer, but we don't bite so give it a shot ;)

### Do you have older coding projects?

Yes, they're available here: https://github.com/promise/graveyard 🪦
