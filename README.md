## FAQ

### You have unsigned commits, why?

I am trying out [vigilant mode](https://docs.github.com/github/authenticating-to-github/displaying-verification-statuses-for-all-of-your-commits) on GitHub, starting from November 1st 2021. Any commits before this that is "unverified" is still me, but I will try and verify each commit going forward.
